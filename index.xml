      <description>So many of my reflections on my experiences while travelling hark back to my longings for travel during my teenage years.
My High School History teacher was a great story teller. For our &amp;lsquo;O&amp;rsquo; Levels, the period of study was 1789 to 1914: political history during the time of the destruction of the ancien r√©gime in Europe and the development of Nationalism as a new political ideology &amp;hellip; hence my fascination with its revival in the lands of the former Communist Bloc.</description>

      <description>My teenage years were dominated by the intensity of the Cold War. At the other end of Europe, there was this strange, unfamiliar place behind the &amp;ldquo;Iron Curtain&amp;rdquo;. With my shortwave receiver I had static-filled access to signals from &amp;ldquo;Behind the Iron Curtain&amp;rdquo;. It was a place of sinister mystery from which I could listen to broadcasts denouncing Imperialists and Fascists as the sun set and atmospheric conditions allowed the signals to penetrate more strongly.</description>

      <description>The first day in Kazakhstan turned out not be so much of a disaster once the misunderstanding with our tour guide had been settled.
We stayed in the Soviet-era Almaty Hotel, slap bang in the middle of the city. For me, after so long in Thailand, it was great to be able to eat an East European breakfast again &amp;hellip; for Almaty is like an enclave of European Russia in the far East.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve just travelled overland across the Former Soviet Union from Almaty in the East to Tbilisi in the West. (Batumi next week, then the ferry to Bulgaria.)
They say that travellers start of speechless and end up as story-tellers. It always takes me time to process my experiences. As we spend our last few days in the Caucasus Mountains, I am free to rest and reflect on a few things.</description>

      <title>Kazakhstan Day 1</title>

      <description>Kazakhstan Day 1 Not a great start! But a fun adventure nonetheless. We had arranged many months in advance to stay with our tour guides, at their house.
We expected to see them when we arrived at Almaty Airport but there was no sign of them. But how to contact them? Our contact had been over Telegram so I tried to connect to the free Almaty Airport WiFi. It hung on &amp;ldquo;Getting IP Address&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Rules for Photography</title>

      <description>My Rules for Photography My Rules for Photography are based on idea that our world is flooded with too many ephemeral images from smart-phones.
I used to enjoy photography in the olden days of film but as we moved into the digital age I lost interest. Anyway, my wife&amp;rsquo;s composition skills were way better than mine so she became the sole operator of our digital camera. My basic manual SLR got dumped as a piece of junk that was just too bulky to bother with when moving house.</description>

      <title>God and Religion</title>

      <description>God and/versus Religion There is only one definition of the word &amp;ldquo;God&amp;rdquo; that makes sense to me:
That which caused the existence of the cosmos, including me.
I exist The Cosmos exists Something caused the Cosmos and me to exist That Something gets the name &amp;ldquo;God&amp;rdquo; This concept of God radically simplifies this thing we call &amp;ldquo;Religion&amp;rdquo;.
It is simply about connecting with the Creator.
The Cosmos could be self-creating but to my mind this is absurd.</description>

      <description>Six times round the square The call to prayer from the nearby mosque wakes us up early most mornings. If we don&amp;rsquo;t go out in time, it gets too hot to walk. 8am is the limit.
We walk through the Muslim quarter where all the breakfast places are already full with guys filling their tummies before they go off to work. Each one has his bird in its cage. The bird is a member of the family and will be taken to one of the regular birdsong competitions in the town.</description>

      <description>Popular Capitalism Popular Capitalism was all the rage in 1982. The markets were being freed from the deadening hand of oppressive market regulations. The most vibrant sector of the new market economy was the consumer tech sector, especially affordable home computers. The two leading tech entrepreneurs in the UK at the time were Sir Clive Sinclar and Alan Sugar of Amstrad. These guys were my teenage heros.
Mr Shawcross My mother was a founder member of the Over-25 Club, a social group for people who wanted to go on rambles, play boardgames, etc, with like-minded people.</description>

      <description>Mr Knight When I started High School, it was the first time that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sent off to school in a butyric-acid-generating Thrift Shop uniform. Things were definitely improving for us under Maggie Fatcher.
The French teacher, Mr Knight, was a man in his fifties who was going to seed. He teeth were beyond what Americans think of as British Teeth. He smelled of garlic. He was a chain smoker and his tweed jacket reeked of tobacco and nicotine.</description>

      <description>The book on my mother&amp;rsquo;s bedside table I first encountered Anna when I was 17. I saw the book on my mother&amp;rsquo;s bedside table. The title immediately attracted me. Anna Karenina. The name sounded beautiful, Russian and mysterious. I started reading:
Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.
If I&amp;rsquo;m not hooked by the first line of a book, it&amp;rsquo;s usually a sign I will struggle with the rest of the book.</description>

      <description>Maggie Fatcher When I was 9, Mr Woolgar, the odd job man who did odd jobs for us, let me stay with him and his family at Butlins in Bognor Regis. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know why I was sent there but it was fun playing in the boats and the monorail. Mr Woolgar put the telly on in the evening for the news about the 1979 General Election. Maggie Fatcher had won.</description>

      <description>Cartage Sussex is famous now because of its troublesome Duchess but the county she is Duchess of is an ancient Saxon kingdom that stubbornly maintained its independence for centuries before falling to the sword of Wessex, and eventually becoming a very English part of England.
The Isle of Wight, too, was a fiercely independent appendage at the bottom of England that bore the brunt of many French adventures over the centuries.</description>
