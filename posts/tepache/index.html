<p>The call to prayer from the nearby mosque wakes us up early most mornings. If we don&rsquo;t go out in time, it gets too hot to walk. 8am is the limit.</p>
<p>We walk through the Muslim quarter where all the breakfast places are already full with guys filling their tummies before they go off to work. Each one has his bird in
its cage. The bird is a member of the family and will be taken to one of the <a href="https://www.dreamstime.com/teakwood-cage-red-whiskered-bulbul-bird-haven-ko-panyi-floating-muslim-village-member-singing-competition-video151568500">regular birdsong competitions</a> in the town.</p>
<p>During the renovation of our delapidated office building into a modern, minimalist, bare-metal home, we would go to inspect the work, and sometimes three
bird cages would be hanging up, with the most beautiful sounds coming from the birds.</p>
<p>I love the local halal food shops, especially the rotis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Us525mXShIM">Roti with banana is a particular pleasure</a>.</p>
<p>On the other side of the Islamic Quarter is the district walking square. Every district has one: a place laid out for morning exercise and for buying the
day&rsquo;s food supplies. We walk there and do six rounds watching the Tai Qi people make their graceful moves.</p>
<h1 id="stalls">Stalls</h1>
<p>Every day, the same stalls are there.</p>
<ul>
<li>The soy milk man.</li>
<li>The fried chicken lady.</li>
<li>The barbecue pork girl.</li>
<li>The English-speaking tomato lady who gives great tips on making tomato sauces.</li>
<li>The coconut family, who arrive in a pickup full of <a href="https://youtu.be/RlHQb62_5iY">young fresh coconuts</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And</p>
<ul>
<li>The pineapple pair.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-pineapple-pair">The Pineapple Pair</h1>
<p>&hellip; are a mother-daughter team who strip the skin off their pineapples and sell beautifully formed pineapple pieces, ready to eat.</p>
<p>They constantly banter with each other and make giggly comments about the young guys exercising in the park.</p>
<p>The customer gets only
the very sweetest, best part of the pineapple. The other parts go in a large plastic bag.</p>
<p>The Pineapple Pair give me a bag-load of skin and core. I take it home, put it in a jar, and fill up the jar with sugar water.</p>
<p>Four days later it is ready.</p>
<h1 id="tepache">Tepache</h1>
<p>The result is a delicious <a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7996596/tepache/">Tepache</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a naturally fermented drink. There are yeasts and bacteria on the skin that convert the sugar into this incredible combination of light alcohol
and lactic acid. It is unbelievably healthy too with probiotics coming out of its ears.</p>
<p>This is the essence of the bare-metal life. Take the simplest food ingredients &ndash; in this case the bits that would normally go in the bin &ndash; and make something amazing
out of them.</p>
