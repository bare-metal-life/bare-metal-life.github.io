      I have always had a soft spot for Albania. They always seemed to end up being the underdogs of the Balkans, and also I have only ever had positive interactions with Albanians.
Albanians have the misfortune to live on the Balkan peninsula at the same time as not being Slavs, Greeks or Turks. They have had to somehow carve out living space for themselves in competition with the Serbs in particular &ndash; the situation in Kosovo being the eventual result.

      At the end of my last blog post on Skopje and &ldquo;North Macedonia&rdquo; I mentioned the EU, and how I couldn&rsquo;t imagine the people who call themselves &ldquo;Macedonians&rdquo; knuckling down under the supervision of the grey persons of Brussels. Yesterday was a confirmation of my hunch in a way, although not in the way I had expected.
We chose to take a tour out to a beautiful reservoir called Matka Canyon.

      The Cultural Intensity of Skopje Again, my teenage romanticisation of the Balkans is coming into play, and again, Skopje has not disappointed, but has exceeded expectations.
I am in Skopje now &hellip; and it has revealed to me how much mere book knowledge of a place can in no way replace an actual visit.
&ldquo;North Macedonia&rdquo; had long puzzled me (and, I must admit, amused me). On paper, it is a place the speaks a dialect of Bulgarian, written with the Serbian version of the Cyrillic alphabet.

      So many of my reflections on my experiences while travelling hark back to my longings for travel during my teenage years.
My High School History teacher was a great story teller. For our &lsquo;O&rsquo; Levels, the period of study was 1789 to 1914: political history during the time of the destruction of the ancien r√©gime in Europe and the development of Nationalism as a new political ideology &hellip; hence my fascination with its revival in the lands of the former Communist Bloc.

      My teenage years were dominated by the intensity of the Cold War. At the other end of Europe, there was this strange, unfamiliar place behind the &ldquo;Iron Curtain&rdquo;. With my shortwave receiver I had static-filled access to signals from &ldquo;Behind the Iron Curtain&rdquo;. It was a place of sinister mystery from which I could listen to broadcasts denouncing Imperialists and Fascists as the sun set and atmospheric conditions allowed the signals to penetrate more strongly.

      The first day in Kazakhstan turned out not be so much of a disaster once the misunderstanding with our tour guide had been settled.
We stayed in the Soviet-era Almaty Hotel, slap bang in the middle of the city. For me, after so long in Thailand, it was great to be able to eat an East European breakfast again &hellip; for Almaty is like an enclave of European Russia in the far East.

      We&rsquo;ve just travelled overland across the Former Soviet Union from Almaty in the East to Tbilisi in the West. (Batumi next week, then the ferry to Bulgaria.)
They say that travellers start of speechless and end up as story-tellers. It always takes me time to process my experiences. As we spend our last few days in the Caucasus Mountains, I am free to rest and reflect on a few things.

      Kazakhstan Day 1 Not a great start! But a fun adventure nonetheless. We had arranged many months in advance to stay with our tour guides, at their house.
We expected to see them when we arrived at Almaty Airport but there was no sign of them. But how to contact them? Our contact had been over Telegram so I tried to connect to the free Almaty Airport WiFi. It hung on &ldquo;Getting IP Address&rdquo;.

      My Rules for Photography My Rules for Photography are based on idea that our world is flooded with too many ephemeral images from smart-phones.
I used to enjoy photography in the olden days of film but as we moved into the digital age I lost interest. Anyway, my wife&rsquo;s composition skills were way better than mine so she became the sole operator of our digital camera. My basic manual SLR got dumped as a piece of junk that was just too bulky to bother with when moving house.
