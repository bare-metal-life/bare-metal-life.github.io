      Exponential Productivity I am a freelancer, digital nomad, and sometimes an entrepreneur. As such, I am often required to account for my time to a client using the dreaded Timesheet. I always have a problem with this because:
I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO MEASURE THE TIME I SPEND ON A PROJECT!
And suddenly, recently, I understood why &hellip; because of a passing comment by my Russian teacher in one of her episodes about her life as a teacher, student and as a Russian outside Russia.

      This month has taken me far out of my comfort zone. I have been dealing with property transactions, tax matters, renovations, and other financial issues in three different jurisdictions. I have had many sleepless nights composing plans, letters to solicitors, accountants, tax departments etc. Because of my situation, I am dealing with English, Thai and Russian professionals.
I am coming back to my comfort zone, and in doing so, I have done some &lsquo;inner work&rsquo; about understanding my motivations in life.

      More thoughts on language &ndash; In which I describe some observations about how people use foreign languages, and explain my motivation for learning Thai and Russian.
This post was inspired by a video produced by Maria, my Russian phonetics coach. She described three types of Russian language learner:
The linguistic sportsman who conquers languages in the way Genghis Khan conquered territory The person who in everyday life is Roger but in his heart is Dostoevsky &ndash; who is in love with the &ldquo;Russian Soul&rdquo; The &lsquo;spy&rsquo;, who lives among Russians and who wants to sound like a native when he speaks.

      I am writing this on a rooftop in the beautiful city of Mostar, Herzegovina, which was the site of vicious street fighting between Bosniaks and Croats in 1993. I am in a beautifully renovated apartment but the house next door has simply been patched up to accommodate the huge shell hole in its wall.
In one of the many bookshops here, I picked up Yugoslavia &ndash; My Fatherland by Goran Vojnović.

      I have always had a soft spot for Albania. They always seemed to end up being the underdogs of the Balkans, and also I have only ever had positive interactions with Albanians.
Albanians have the misfortune to live on the Balkan peninsula at the same time as not being Slavs, Greeks or Turks. They have had to somehow carve out living space for themselves in competition with the Serbs in particular &ndash; the situation in Kosovo being the eventual result.

      At the end of my last blog post on Skopje and &ldquo;North Macedonia&rdquo; I mentioned the EU, and how I couldn&rsquo;t imagine the people who call themselves &ldquo;Macedonians&rdquo; knuckling down under the supervision of the grey persons of Brussels. Yesterday was a confirmation of my hunch in a way, although not in the way I had expected.
We chose to take a tour out to a beautiful reservoir called Matka Canyon.

      The Cultural Intensity of Skopje Again, my teenage romanticisation of the Balkans is coming into play, and again, Skopje has not disappointed, but has exceeded expectations.
I am in Skopje now &hellip; and it has revealed to me how much mere book knowledge of a place can in no way replace an actual visit.
&ldquo;North Macedonia&rdquo; had long puzzled me (and, I must admit, amused me). On paper, it is a place the speaks a dialect of Bulgarian, written with the Serbian version of the Cyrillic alphabet.

      So many of my reflections on my experiences while travelling hark back to my longings for travel during my teenage years.
My High School History teacher was a great story teller. For our &lsquo;O&rsquo; Levels, the period of study was 1789 to 1914: political history during the time of the destruction of the ancien régime in Europe and the development of Nationalism as a new political ideology &hellip; hence my fascination with its revival in the lands of the former Communist Bloc.

      My teenage years were dominated by the intensity of the Cold War. At the other end of Europe, there was this strange, unfamiliar place behind the &ldquo;Iron Curtain&rdquo;. With my shortwave receiver I had static-filled access to signals from &ldquo;Behind the Iron Curtain&rdquo;. It was a place of sinister mystery from which I could listen to broadcasts denouncing Imperialists and Fascists as the sun set and atmospheric conditions allowed the signals to penetrate more strongly.

      The first day in Kazakhstan turned out not be so much of a disaster once the misunderstanding with our tour guide had been settled.
We stayed in the Soviet-era Almaty Hotel, slap bang in the middle of the city. For me, after so long in Thailand, it was great to be able to eat an East European breakfast again &hellip; for Almaty is like an enclave of European Russia in the far East.
