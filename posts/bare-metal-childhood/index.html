<p>Sussex is famous now because of its troublesome Duchess but the county she is Duchess of is an ancient Saxon kingdom that stubbornly maintained its
independence for centuries before falling to the sword of Wessex, and eventually becoming a very English part of England.</p>
<p>The Isle of Wight, too, was a fiercely independent appendage at the bottom of England that bore the brunt of many French adventures over the centuries.</p>
<p>There once was a Scovell on the Isle of Wight who fancied his chances on the mainland. Arriving in Sussex, he bought a hearse-shaped cart and a friendly,
docile horse to pull it, and started a cartage service. If you wanted bits and pieces carried around Sussex, Scovell was your man.</p>
<p>It turned out that the thing that people most wanted carted around was coal, so old Scovell decided to specialise in this black commodity. Eventually
he bought out his customer and became coal merchant and courier to the good people of Sussex. He did rather well out of it. He caught the eye of a young lady
and eventually there were two daughters and a son and two world wars later, these three siblings would inherit the business, which they worked at until
retirement. Uncle Charlie, the boy, married, but his sisters didn&rsquo;t. Instead, they adopted two war babies, one of whom would become my mother.</p>
<p>I was born into the silver-spooned wealth of retired county coal merchants but I was barely six when disaster struck. The 1970s were a decade of
terrible financial calamity across the world. The family relied on some rather interesting investments, including remote railways in South America, but the
crises of that decade finished them off. We were impoverished. Sometimes a meal would be mashed potatoes and fried onion. On a good day there would be some
liver too. My private education had to stop, of course, so off to the State primary I went.</p>
<p>I needed a uniform, of course, but there were barely two brass farthings to rub together.</p>
<h1 id="the-thrift-shop">The Thrift Shop</h1>
<p>If you indulge in food fermentation, sometimes something goes terribly wrong, and you end up growing a culture of bacteria who do nothing but generate
butyric acid. Butyric acid is what provides vomit and Herscheys Chocolate with their distinctive smells. Sweaty feet and discarded socks also provide a
welcome habitat for these critters.</p>
<p>To get my new uniform, we walked around the back of Warwick Street, into the old mews, and climbed a metal staircase pinned to the back of the building.
At the top of the stairs was a door, which had been painted grey at some point many years before. Through the door was a suprising scenario. Staffed
by disapproving but philanthropic ladies, the Thrift Shop was a place where you could get a few coppers for your growing child&rsquo;s old uniform, and the old
ladies would sell them on to the harried parents of scruffy urchins such as myself.</p>
<p>The pre-hated uniforms were piled up on trestle tables where they cultivated that distinctive butyric acid smell, along with mould and other horrors.</p>
<p>I was sized up by one of these caring tyrants, who went to the table labelled for my new school and pulled out my new uniform. I was ordered to change into it
there and then. It just about fit me. The Thrift Shop Visit would become an annual event in late August, in time for the start of each new school year.</p>
