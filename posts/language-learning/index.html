<p>When I started High School, it was the first time that I wasn&rsquo;t sent off to school in a butyric-acid-generating Thrift Shop uniform. Things were
definitely improving for us under Maggie Fatcher.</p>
<p>The French teacher, Mr Knight, was a man in his fifties who was going to seed. He teeth were beyond what Americans think of as British Teeth. He smelled of
garlic. His hair was never cut and trailed down the back of his neck in greasy curls. Despite all that, he was the friendliest teacher we had. Although from
London, his French accent was Provencale.</p>
<p>On the first day he handed out our textbooks. A series of stories about a kawai-cute little girl called Chantal and her family and pets. Officially, we were
supposed to learn about her quotidien life.</p>
<p>Mr Knight had none of it. A phrase in the book would trigger a memory from his dissolate youth. Many of the stories were from Moscow, where he had
unaccountably studied for a while. The story that sticks in my mind most was when he supposedly found an abandoned toilet and he and his tovarishchi
cemented it to a traffic island in Moscow city centre.</p>
<p>Whether or not his stories, peppered with random French expressions, were strictly true, his lessons were a favourite.</p>
<p>At the end of each lesson he would tell us just to go home and write out the vocabulary and conversations of our overly-sweet Chantal as she travelled on
trains, fed her dogs, and ate her croissant dipped in cafe-au-lait.</p>
<p>We had to write them out several times over.</p>
<p>I thought I wasn&rsquo;t learning anything and I didn&rsquo;t go on to take O Level French but strangely, when I travelled, I seemed to be able to manage enough basics
to get myself around. I could buy tickets, travel on trains and buses, and order cafe-au-lait to dip my croissant in. In short, I could do anything that
Chantal did.</p>
<h1 id="thai-and-russian">Thai and Russian</h1>
<p>Many years later, I am learning Thai and Russian. I tried apps and various online language learning methods but I made very slow progress.</p>
<p>Then I discovered the grandiosely-named &ldquo;Gold List Method&rdquo;. Guess what it is? You write down vocabulary and then come back to it two weeks later to see
what you have retained. You then repeat the process daily. You can do up to 300 expressions daily, in groups of 20. You will probably retain about a third
of each list over two weeks. Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>It is the physical act of writing down the expressions, slowly and carefully, that embeds them in your mind.</p>
<p>Mr Knight knew his craft as a teacher, even though we thought he was a time-waster.</p>
