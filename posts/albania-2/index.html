<p>It means that autists (a word I coined long before the Internet, analogous to <em>artist</em>) are not constrained by social trends but can pick and choose
what to follow and what to ignore. One of the key &rsquo;tells&rsquo; for &ldquo;High Functioning Autism&rdquo; is that the autist will simply observe peer behaviour and group
activities without any inner compunction to join in. The autist will even go so far as to question why the group is doing what they are doing &hellip; but
you quickly learn not to question social behaviour.</p>
<p>Why is this relevant to my journey through the Balkans? It&rsquo;s because the autist is socially free to attach to minority interests without feeling any
concern about it not being socially acceptable. In my case, I developed an obsession with Albania and Albanians. I&rsquo;ve already written about my
fascination with the Balkan region while studying for my History &lsquo;O&rsquo; Level. My fascination was driven by listening to the Hoxha-ist Radio Tirana
every night, marvelling at how such an apparently insignificant nation could be at such loggerheads with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>So the strength of autism is the ability to observe social trends without feeling any need to participate. Autists are great at detailed observation of
patterns &hellip; and surprisingly that does include social behavioral patterns &hellip; but it&rsquo;s only surprising because the autist&rsquo;s observations are not
matched by a desire to participate.</p>
<p>Again, how is this relevant?</p>
<p>My goal during my travels has been to document the legacies of the various forms of Communism and Socialism in the countries we have passed through.
At first, while trying to photograph various remnants of the Communist era, I have been frustrated by the presence of artefacts of current-day culture
&lsquo;cluttering up&rsquo; scenes I want to photography for my documentary project.</p>
<p>Then I had an epiphany.</p>
<p>We are going through a phase in history now that is creating its own cultural artefacts &hellip; but they are temporary and will soon pass. Who is actually
documenting them photographically, as opposed to them being just the default background to contemporary life when people take selfies and share-shots with their mobile
phones?</p>
<p>In the centre of every European city you can find the same elements &hellip;</p>
<h2 id="restaurants">Restaurants</h2>
<p>European cities centres all have the same restaurants. They may have different names, and they may be skewed towards the local cuisine, but the menus
are basically the same from Batumi to Brighton. These restaurants are slightly above average. They are slightly expensive, but not
break-the-bank expensive. You can go anywhere and order the same burgers (but up a level from Big Macs and Whoppers). They all serve the same salads
with balsamic vinegar and and extra virgin olive oil, the same Tom Yum that is not quite Thai, the same chick pea and hummus mezze plates, etc. When you
travel, you have to do some research to find authentic local cuisine, cooked and eaten as real locals cook and eat it. When you find such places,
the quantities on your plate increase and the price decreases. You get an actual teapot full of tea rather than a small coffee cup with hot water and a
tea bag in a paper sachet on the side.</p>
<h2 id="walking-street">Walking Street</h2>
<p>You can walk down the designated walking street and buy the overpriced trinkets with the country name and flag on them.</p>
<h2 id="unused-cycle-lanes">Unused cycle lanes</h2>
<p>Unused cycle lanes are an international phenomenon. We&rsquo;ve all seen them &hellip; drivers have to be careful not to be caught violating them
by digital cameras on poles, even if no cyclist is actually using them.</p>
<h2 id="kindergarten-art-and-architecture">Kindergarten Art and Architecture</h2>
<p>Plovdiv is an ancient city &hellip; perhaps the most ancient in Europe, according to local claims. Despite this, one of the most-Instagrammed spots is
a sign that says &ldquo;together&rdquo; in English in kindergarten colours.</p>
<h2 id="the-hub">The Hub</h2>
<p>Every shared workspace in the world is called The Hub or similar. I bought my films in Tbilisi in &ldquo;The Impact Hub&rdquo;. The Hipster aesthetic is still
very much alive in The Hubs around the world.</p>
<p>There are many more common features &hellip; and I have decided to consciously include them in my photography &hellip; and indeed base my next photography
project around them as I travel. No more are they annoying intrusions of modernity &hellip; now I am choosing to document them on film, to be
developed and printed into a semi-permanent archive. Of course there are billions of digital photos but very few of them are an intentional attempt
to capture a period of history, and their permanence is only as long as their creators are willing to pay for Cloud Storage to accommodate them.</p>
<p>Today I took a photo of the Tirana Pyramid &hellip; a former piece of unfinished Communist architecture that is now home to an innovation hub &hellip; I made sure
to include a guy in typical 2023 shorts and T-shirt, while a fellow photographer was waiting with increasing frustration to get a shot devoid of persons.</p>
