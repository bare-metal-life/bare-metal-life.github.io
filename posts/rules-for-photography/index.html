<p>My Rules for Photography are based on idea that our world is flooded with too many ephemeral images from smart-phones.</p>
<p>I used to enjoy photography in the olden days of film but as we moved into the digital age I lost interest. Anyway, my wife&rsquo;s composition skills were way
better than mine so she became the sole operator of our digital camera. My basic manual SLR got dumped as a piece of junk that was just too bulky to
bother with when moving house.</p>
<p>I have ordered a replacement on e-Bay: a Praktica MTL-5 from Communist East Germany.</p>
<p>I have made a few Rules for myself when using my new equipment because:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t want to waste film</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not trying to get a social media following</li>
<li>I want my photos to be personal to me.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rule-1">Rule #1.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take any photos with film that can be taken with a smart-phone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone goes to the same places and takes the same photos. On some tours I have been on, there are even photo stops to
allow everyone to take the same photo in the same spot with the same hand-gestures.</p>
<h2 id="rule-2">Rule #2.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to be arty or &lsquo;make a statement&rsquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not interested in art for art&rsquo;s sake. I am also not interested in art that tries to make a statement or a social comment. I find that such art
is highly stereotyped: for example, photos showing the contrast between a Bangkok slum and a Bangkok sky-scraper. Everyone knows that there is extreme
inequality. Photos like these do nothing to help people in slums. They are poverty-porn and I hate them.</p>
<p>A too-high percentage of art photography, and art in general, seeks to express the ultimate meaninglessness of life. It gets boring.</p>
<p>Another problem with art for art&rsquo;s sake photography is that the photographs are designed to show off the photographer&rsquo;s skill at composition and
technical manipulation of the camera. I do not want to be associated with this narcissistic endeavour.</p>
<h2 id="rule-3">Rule #3.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Each photograph should have personal meaning for me in relation to my travel experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to look over them later and enter a state of melancholy nostalgia for the time of that journey.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is the guy I made friends with at the picnic site and we talked about the situation in Ukraine</li>
<li>This is the church where I felt peace in the presence of a particular icon</li>
<li>This is where I walked 3 miles with someone who said something that helped me make sense of something I am struggling with.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rule-4">Rule #4.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Let the Sun choose the subject for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Point my camera at what the Sun is highlighting. Do not fight the Sun&rsquo;s light for a subject I want to focus on but which is in a murky shadow.</p>
<p>Fighting the Sun is the best way to waste expensive film. If it&rsquo;s in shadow then it&rsquo;s not going to look great when the film is developed. Photography is
fundamentally about capturing light so I want to use the best light available.</p>
<h2 id="rule-4b">Rule #4B.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Rule #4 should not break Rule #3. The subject should still be something meaningful to me and not just ars gratia artis.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="rule-5">Rule #5.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Stick to photographing after sunrise and before sunset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This allows the Sun to choose the subject for me. In the main heat of the day there will not be much contrast and my photos will be dull and boring.</p>
<p>This also helps with Rule #6.</p>
<h2 id="rule-6">Rule #6.</h2>
<p>The Camera must not be allowed to dominate the Journey.</p>
<p>If you want to know when I post something new, I will announce it in
<a href="https://t.me/+5ynyNkmHbNIxZDE1">this Telegram group</a> and <a href="https://signal.group/#CjQKIDvIEgOpfae5GL5qQ0fBROHu4e1VsbX8Pbo-IBFdHZKJEhC8y3iq5hmgfbaX0z1eJtg-">this Signal group</a></p>
