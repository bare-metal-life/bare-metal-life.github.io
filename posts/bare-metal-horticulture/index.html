<p>When I was 9, Mr Woolgar, the odd job man who did odd jobs for us, let me stay with him and his family at Butlins in Bognor Regis. I didn&rsquo;t know why
I was sent there but it was fun playing in the boats and the monorail. Mr Woolgar put the telly on in the evening for the news about the 1970 General
Election. Maggie Fatcher had won. &ldquo;Another Prime Minister,&rdquo; I thought. I was used to them coming and going in rapid succession. I thought she wouldn&rsquo;t last.</p>
<p>When I got back to my family, I found out why I had been sent away. Granny, one of the coal merchant&rsquo;s daughters, had been taken ill, taken to hospital,
and died. The odd job man and his family kindly agreed to look after me while the adults sorted everything out.</p>
<h1 id="aunty-marion">Aunty Marion</h1>
<p>The coal merchant&rsquo;s son had married but they never had any children. He died when I was two. Aunty Marion stayed close to her family. When I turned 12,
Aunty Marion solemnly told me that I was now the man of the house, which was a grave and heavy responsibility. I took her seriously.</p>
<h1 id="mr-shawcross">Mr Shawcross</h1>
<p>The father of a friend of my mother, Mr Shawcross, had been an electronic engineer during the War. He had done something very clever but very secret. I
liked to spend time in his workshop as he puffed on his pipe and soldered. He had a few computers, including the ZX80 that he had built from a kit. He
organised his thoughts and his many projects on the word processor on his Amstrad C128. In modern parlance, it was his Second Brain.</p>
<h1 id="popular-capitalism">Popular Capitalism</h1>
<p>Margaret Thatcher survived as PM, of course, and proceeded to inspire half of the country to new heights of entrepreneurial zeal, and the other half, to
visceral hatred. I was one inspired to entrepreneurial zeal. I was fed up with our lack of money and I wanted to do something about it. We lived next door
to a bus stop used by a constant stream of old ladies. My family life involved a revolving door of old ladies and I knew what they liked to talk about:
pot plants. They were obsessed with the damn things. I wanted a ZX81, the successor to the unit that had so fascinated me in Mr Shawcross&rsquo;s workshop. I took
on two paper rounds but it was not enough. There had to be a quicker way to save the money for this thing! Aha! Old ladies! That&rsquo;s the solution! I bought
some flower pots, some compost and some flower seeds. I had a captive market. They thought I was cute and wanted to encourage my entrepreneurial spirit. I
soon had enough money for my ZX81 and a 16k RAM cartridge.</p>
