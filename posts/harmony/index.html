    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>This month has taken me far out of my comfort zone. I have been dealing with property transactions, tax matters, renovations, and other
financial issues in three different jurisdictions. I have had many sleepless nights composing plans, letters to solicitors, accountants,
tax departments etc. Because of my situation, I am dealing with English, Thai and Russian professionals.</p>
<p>I am coming back to my comfort zone, and in doing so, I have done some &lsquo;inner work&rsquo; about understanding my motivations in life.</p>
<p>I have never been motivated by money. Sometimes I have been motivated by problem-solving, sometimes by intellectual pursuits.</p>
<p>But what have I really been chasing in life? I am sitting on my bed in our temporary home in the jungle, near a Buddhist temple complete with
saffron-clad monks. I can hear cows mooing nearby. I am listening to a version of the Divine Liturgy sung by the beautiful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CwflYdOUI&amp;pp=ygUPZGl2bmEgbGl0dXJnaWph">Divna Ljubevic and
some deep-voiced priests and deacons</a>.
Farm smallholders live nearby in huts made from bamboo and other nearby materials. When I take a moment
to cool my brain down from trying to understand tax codes, I realise that I am experiencing that which motivates me: Harmony.</p>
<p>I have been interested in philosophy and theology since I was a teenager. I have always found the concept of Logos to be compelling and exciting:
this is the idea that underlying the Cosmos is a rational and harmonious reality or plan. The fact that &lsquo;mathematical physics&rsquo; works is
evidence of the reality of the Logos. Every phenomenon in physics turns out to have a rational mathematical model.</p>
<p>My motivation to solve problems is related to this concept: I want to find the rational source of the problem in order to bring order back to the
apparent chaos. I have financial affairs that are in a state of chaos: I cannot sleep until I have brought them to a state of rationality.</p>
<p>For me, rationality and harmony and other &lsquo;good things&rsquo; are closely aligned. By bringing rationality to my financial affairs, I am able to fulfil
the heavy responsibility to steward my family&rsquo;s money, which allows us to live in harnomy. (I corrected a typo: I mistyped that as &lsquo;harmoney&rsquo;!)</p>
<p>But for me these small efforts to bring rationality and harmony point to a deeper motivation in me: to experience the harmony inherent
in existence itself. I am drawn to the theology of the Logos Incarnate of Orthodox Christianity. In Christ, there is the promise of all things
being brought into harmony in the present and in the future. In the practice of my Orthodox faith, I experience that harmony intensely. There are also
strong shadows of the Logos in the foundational principles of Buddhism and Taoism. I can experience the harmony, but to a lesser extent, in the temple
around the corner, where the monks strive to live in harmony with the Dhamma.</p>
<p>When I am stressed and far from my comfort zone, I will remind myself in future about the goal of my problem-solving: to bring the underlying
harmony of the Universe into the details of my own life.</p>
