<p>Not a great start! But a fun adventure nonetheless. We had arranged many months in advance to stay with our tour guides, at their house.</p>
<p>We expected to see them when we arrived at Almaty Airport but there was no sign of them. But how to contact them? Our contact had been over Telegram
so I tried to connect to the free Almaty Airport WiFi. It hung on &ldquo;Getting IP Address&rdquo;. What about roaming? Ah, need to top up my AIS balance first. Great.</p>
<p>Eventually the free WiFi connected &hellip; only to throw up a login screen that required my phone number. I put my Thai number in. Number rejected. I went to
the Information desk. Almaty Airport is still very Soviet. The lady told me that only Kazakhstan mobile numbers can be used to access the free airport
WiFi. Great circular dependency loop. I&rsquo;d rather use my AIS roaming as it&rsquo;s cheaper than the SIMs available at the airport. But I can&rsquo;t do that because I need
an internet connection to access my bank app to top up.</p>
<p>The SIM seller was a teenage girl with a sulky attitude, sighing and rolling her eyes whenever a customer wanted to pay for the stuff that pays her wages.</p>
<p>The sulky girl installed my SIM with lightning speed fingers.</p>
<p>There was nothing on Telegram from the tour company.</p>
<p>There were plenty of taxi touts looking for a good opportunity to overcharge, and we could only put ourselves at the mercy of one of them. He was helpful in
suggesting a hotel and getting us there, but certainly at a high cost to us. C&rsquo;est la vie. He talked about his family &ndash; wife and four children, youngest a
three year old. His responsibility is to provide for them so I don&rsquo;t feel too sore about being taken for a ride by him.</p>
<p>The outcomes were all good. I got to practice my Russian, and to start to feel confident using it. We got to stay in a Soviet era hotel overlooking the opera
house and the high mountains. We got to walk along the Arbat with the beautiful people promenading in the evening, playing music, and generally being mellow
chilled.</p>
<p>What had happened to the tour guides? Total misunderstanding about arrangements between us, probably due to my typically English understated use of language.</p>
<p>They were under the jeep changing oil and otherwise prepping it for the journey &hellip; and simply hadn&rsquo;t heard the Telegram notifications.</p>
