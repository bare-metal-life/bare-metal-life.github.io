<p>It was our last day in the Balkans. As we were preparing to leave Istanbul, Polly was looking at her phone, shocked and white-faced, as
she read about the details of the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel at a concert. I&rsquo;ll never forget the harrowing images of idealistic
young people, terrified to the core of their being, as they were chased by men in Hiluxes and powered parachutes, firing at them mercilessly.</p>
<p>It felt like an era-defining moment such as 9-11.</p>
<h2 id="pro-palestine-marches-in-london">Pro-Palestine marches in London</h2>
<p>Almost immediately, as though long-planned, huge pro-Palestine marches started up in London as well as other large cities around the world.</p>
<p>Anti-Semitism suddenly burst out all over, in places where it hasn&rsquo;t been seen for decades.</p>
<p>The marches combined the usual coalition of UK-based Muslims and left-wing activists.</p>
<p>I was deeply saddened, but far from surprised by this: a former friend, steeped in Marxism, to the left of the Corbynite wing of the Labour Party,
posted on Facebook in 2014 a deeply offensive and derogatory comment about &ldquo;That lot in Golders Green&rdquo; (i.e. the London Jewish community). This
was a man who insisted that anti-Zionism was not a form of anti-Semitism, a myth that I had even bought into at one point, when I was more naive about
politics.</p>
<p>Such an anti-Semitic comment is beyond the pale for me. I cannot have anything to do with someone who holds such beliefs.</p>
<p>The pro-Palestine marches continue. The rise in anti-Semitism in the UK has not abated.</p>
<h2 id="southern-thailand">Southern Thailand</h2>
<p>I live in a province of Thailand that has a large Muslim population.</p>
<p>I live comfortably and peacefully in this province, with its deeply conservative, traditional, and relaxed ambience.</p>
<p>However, it has been puzzling me, ever since the 7th of October, why I have not seen
pro-Palestine marches, or Palestine flags everywhere, as in London now.</p>
<p>Instinctively, I feel that the kind of Islam being lived out here is very different from the kind of Islam that has established itself on
UK territory.</p>
<p>Today I got my answer in the form of an article in <a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/israel-middle-east/articles/liberation-arabs-global-left">Tablet Magazine</a>.</p>
<p>The short answer is this: in Thailand, Islam is a traditional way of life, similar to how Catholicism is in Poland. In the Arab world, however,
it is a revolutionary ideology that has fused a revolutionary reading of Islam with Marxism, into something like the &ldquo;Liberation Theology&rdquo; of
South America.</p>
<p>It is extremely concerning how much this ideology has become embedded in territories of Western Europe. I fear for the future of those territories.</p>
