    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>My teenage years were dominated by the intensity of the Cold War. At the other end of Europe, there was this strange, unfamiliar place behind the
&ldquo;Iron Curtain&rdquo;. With my shortwave receiver I had static-filled access to signals from &ldquo;Behind the Iron Curtain&rdquo;. It was a place of sinister mystery from
which I could listen to broadcasts denouncing Imperialists and Fascists as the sun set and atmospheric conditions allowed the signals to penetrate more
strongly.</p>
<p>The mystery of this sinister place, glimpsed through these radio broadcasts and through grainy black and white images of grimy, miserable cities created
a great attraction for me. Is anyone immune to the attractiveness of the mysterious? Three months after the Berlin Wall fell I was able to go behind the
veil to see what had been revealed, on a coach journey to a Taize meeting in Poland. It was a gruelling 36 hour journey and I woke up as we passed through
snow-bound East Germany. Workers were emerging from tower blocks, wiping the snow off their Trabants, firing them up with that characteristic two-stroke sound,
and driving off to work. Who were they? Where were they going? Were they off to pretend to work while the government pretended to pay them, as joked by
Ronald Reagan? I could hardly see them through the early morning mist, which added to the sense of mystery.</p>
<p>Of course, the reality is that they were leading normal lives. Normality is the same everywhere. We all have to work, eat, take the children to school, etc.</p>
<p>I could see them as through a veil, and they seemed mysterious. When daylight comes, nothing is mysterious.</p>
<p>The Eastern Bloc had another mysterious thing: Closed Cities, where mysterious people would work on fantastic scientific and technological projects. In 2023
I finally got the chance to visit a Closed City. We needed permits to visit: these were obtained with some drama in the preceding months. There is still the
requirement to be accompanied by an official tour guide. Inside the Closed City of Baikonur, where the locals are all involved in space travel, there is still
a Soviet culture. But I just saw ordinary people doing ordinary things like buying kvass and sausages. The tour guide, far from being an intriguing and
enigmatic individual, was a relatively ordinary young woman, whose family had lived in Baikonur for two generations. When the veil is lifted, the mystery
disappears, and the ordinary manifests itself again.</p>
<p>But we seem to yearn for mystery. I certainly do. Mystery allows the imagination to get to work. Mystery calls to me to solve it. But on solution, every time,
the ordinary reveals itself again.</p>
<p>I was drawn to Pure Mathematics because of the mysterious symbols used to express theorems, but once I understood the theorems, the symbols lost their magic.</p>
<p>Cyrillic lettering once expressed the sinister mystery of what lay beyond the Iron Curtain &hellip; but once mastered, your learn that (duh!) these letters are used for items as banal
as cartons of milk and toilet paper.</p>
<p>But again, we seem to need mystery in our lives. Madonna sang, &ldquo;Life is a mystery &hellip; everyone must stand alone&rdquo;. Every other person is ultimately mystery,
and I am certainly a mystery to myself. Sometimes we can&rsquo;t see on the other side of the veil &hellip; and we can&rsquo;t even rip the veil down.</p>
<p>Where is this going? I am becoming increasingly aware of not just the fakeness of the <em>digital world</em>, but also where it stands in relation to Mystery.
When everything is digitised, there is Too Much Information. I could take a digital photo of a street scene in any major city and ask Facebook or Google
to tag every face with their name, and I could probably go further and digitally stalk them, out of prurient interest or, if I had sinister intent,
to blackmail them. (&ldquo;I saw you with Nadia in Plovdiv. I&rsquo;m pretty sure your wife would not be happy.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>When I look at the digital photos that I take with my phone and the megapixels that the sensor captures, I think Too Much Information. The inherent mystery of the
scene is lost.</p>
<p>During my travels in Kazakhstan, we went to a museum dedicated to Kazakh nationalists who had suffered during the Repressions of the Stalin era. There were
many black and white photos of various important events &ndash; uprisings, meetings, protests, kangaroo court cases etc, as well as mug shots of the
individuals who had suffered. There was a quality about these photos that drew me towards them, that inspired me to spend time with them rather than
just moving along. They had obviously been shot on the crude emulsions of the time, developed in the field, and printed in less-than-ideal darkrooms. Since
then they had been scanned and enlarged and printed onto large display boards. The result was that only the key details were present. A collection of
white faces in a street with a flag. What was the slogan? It was hard to make out, but it was in that mysterious Cyrillic script, and in a language that
was not Russian. What was going on over there in the top left? What was the expression on that man&rsquo;s face? What kind of life did that child grow up to have?
The photos gave me glimpses that left me wanting to know more. As an aside, I always feel a sense of pain and grief when I see photos of happy people from,
say, June 1914 or August 1939 &hellip; in their captured joy, they are oblivious to what was about to hit them in the coming weeks. I find myself wondering
what happened to them, especially the children. What horrors did they grow up to experience? Did they live to old age? Were they still alive when I was young,
living alone in some flat surrounded by the melancholy memorabilia of their troubled century, mourning for decades the destruction of a beloved
fiance or father or brother in some grim trench?</p>
<p>I want my own photography to preserve the mystery of a place &ndash; to raise questions in the mind of the viewer. What is this place? What is its history? Who
are these people?</p>
<p>Because even though it seems that when the veil is lifted, only the ordinary is revealed, in fact each person, each place hides depths of mystery that
call out to be honoured. This is why I have started to abandon digital in favour of black and white film photography using vintage cameras and classic film emulsions.
I want to honour the mystery of my subjects &ndash; people or places &ndash; by not sharing megapixels of information about them into a Cloud that is only too happy
to reveal and exploit them.</p>
