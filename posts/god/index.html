<p>There is only one definition of the word &ldquo;God&rdquo; that makes sense to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That which caused the existence of the cosmos, including me.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>I exist</li>
<li>The Cosmos exists</li>
<li><em>Something</em> caused the Cosmos and me to exist</li>
<li>That <em>Something</em> gets the name &ldquo;God&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>This concept of God radically simplifies this thing we call &ldquo;Religion&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It is simply about connecting with the Creator.</p>
<p>The Cosmos could be self-creating but to my mind this is absurd. There is simply too much information embedded in everything that exists.</p>
<p>The Cosmos has a rational structure that can be modelled using mathematics. Patterns can be observed and predicted.
The Cause of the Cosmos imbued it with a rational nature that can be discerned by human beings.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I do not believe we need to theorise about God. We do not need huge books filled with theological reasoning. We do not need to &lsquo;study&rsquo; God.</p>
<p>If God is the Creator of all that is, then surely an uneducated peasant in a muddy field would have just as much ability to connect with his Creator
as some scholar with a dozen academic credentials?</p>
<p>This is my understanding of the &ldquo;Good News&rdquo; of Jesus Christ: that the Creator relates to us like a good father to his children, not as a stony-faced
judge or an impersonal force that created the Cosmos and then just left it to run on by itself.</p>
<p>This is why I eventually found my way to the Orthodox Church &hellip; because of the simplicity of its teaching and its refusal to indulge in pointless
intellectual theorising about the nature of God.</p>
