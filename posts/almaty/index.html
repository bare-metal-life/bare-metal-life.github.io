<p>We stayed in the Soviet-era Almaty Hotel, slap bang in the middle of the city. For me, after so long in Thailand, it was great to be able to eat
an East European breakfast again &hellip; for Almaty is like an enclave of European Russia in the far East.</p>
<p>After breakfast, our tour guide, Kristina, met us to give us a tour of the city. We started down the Arbat, a tree-lined avenue where people hang out,
drinking coffee, eating ice cream, playing the guitar, and generally chilling out.</p>
<p>Marco Polo, in his travels in this region, noted that the cities were often filled with different peoples than the surrounding countryside. It is the same
today. Almaty is culturally and demographically Russian while the surrounding areas are Kazakh. This is a cause of a certain feeling of dislocation among
residents with Russian heritage: they are not living in the country of their heritage, through no fault of their own. The government of Kazakshtan
pursues an ambiguous policy towards Russia itself &ndash; it has interests that lie in both the Russian sphere and that of the Collective West which it must
manage in its delicate foreign policy dance. The nationalist Kazakh element in the government also see itself as part of the Turkic world.</p>
<p>Almaty has an architectural edifice built during Soviet times to remind its people of the stability, strength and impassivity of Soviet State power.
This building is now owned by an entity called the &ldquo;British University of Almaty&rdquo; but when you stand under its pillars you feel the weight of the power
of the State that was so invincible until it collapsed in 1991. The design would be called &ldquo;neo-classical&rdquo; but the Golden Mean is replaced by
proportions that make in inhuman and inhumane.</p>
<p>There is a burnt-out Parliament building, another remnant of Soviet times. Soviet archicture favoured immensity: standing opposite this building are two
enormous circular apartment blocks that tower over a new Kazakh nationalist sculpture showing the layers of Kazakhstan history. The apartment blocks were
a showpiece of the Kazakh SSR but are now rather dilapidated, despite still housing thousands of people.</p>
<p>The Kazakh nationalist sculpture was commissioned by Nur-Sultan Azerbayev, President of modern Kazakhstan for many years after 1991. There is a central
statue, in front of which is a bronze moulding of a book with his hand print in it. Visitors are invited to lay their hand in it &hellip; I&rsquo;m not sure what for.
It reminds me of the obeisance before the great statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang, required of foreign visitors to North Korea.</p>
<p>Most of the independent states that emerged from the USSR have embarked on a feverish exercise in national(ist) myth-making, which tends to make the
foreign visitor feel a little uncomfortable. Not as uncomfortable, of course, as it makes those of Russian heritage.</p>
